everything is good - just needs to be put together - debug and all that 

100% complete

i am workig on a game recorder - i think it is almost finished - it is a chatgpt recorder
   as far as i can tell - it runs extremely fast  - literally no impact - other that many a liyttle stutter at start
   i hove have most of it working - it just needs a couple minor tweaks - hopefully 
   tomorrow - a couple days - soon anyway

performance is very good - but you kow - " it depends ... " 

i used msys  g++  
use the nvidia nvenc nvidia codec intall instructions -    it goes very easy with proper instructions --- 
and not really hard to set up at all --- with proper instructions --

however - bewarre of really screwey installs - it can be very complicated.

next step - combine this into a streaming service and blow OBS out of the water ....  

-------  this should be fine ----------------

alternativly if you have issues with the build - try the windows driver standalone iso - Enterprise WDK (EWDK)
