currently two working versions - 
generic recorder - works will all video cards --- 
cb game recorder - uses N 2000 +   gpu        ----  beta105-opt00mp430eNOTFINAL5.cpp
audio recorder -                                    beta11-opt00c.cpp


oerformance ---    nice   
generic recorder  -60fps  @ 1K is was okay - whatever - as good as anything out the  60 -> 50 fps ?  ish   =  20% loss
commander cb amazing game recorder @ 2K   125 ->  110   fps    ish         =   20 %  loss

----------------------------------------------------------
i am workig on a game recorder - i think it is almost finished - it is a chatgpt recorder
   as far as i can tell - it runs extremely fast  - literally no impact - other that many a liyttle stutter at start
   i hove have most of it working - it just needs a couple minor tweaks - hopefully 
   tomorrow - a couple days - soon anyway
